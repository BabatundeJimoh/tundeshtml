    <p>Our lecturer encouraged us to explore FreeCodeCamp, so I decided to dive in. Initially, it felt like a breeze since I already had some coding experience. However, as I moved further, I realized I’d lost touch with the basics of HTML and CSS—probably because I’ve been so focused on building websites with React. It was a humbling moment but also an exciting opportunity to revisit the fundamentals.
        What started as a simple refresher quickly turned into a rewarding revision session. Step by step, I rediscovered the elegance and simplicity of HTML and CSS, skills that are the backbone of web development. It’s fascinating how revisiting the basics can reignite your appreciation for the building blocks of the web.
 

        I began with some beginner exercises and soon found myself diving deeper into concepts I hadn’t touched in a while. The process wasn’t just about recalling old knowledge; it felt like a journey of relearning and strengthening my foundation, preparing me to merge it seamlessly with modern tools like React. It’s been an eye-opening and surprisingly enjoyable experience! </p>
